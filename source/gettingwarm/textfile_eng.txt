Hello Learniken guys!
Today we are going to start our journey into learning a brilliant programming language, Python.
Magne Alvheim, will do his best to guide you into the Python world.
For starters we will look at the language, how to define variables, how to do loops and branches.
Next we will look at objectoriented Python, how to access databases.
Then we can create a rest based a.p.i. to access the databases.
